Inspired by http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3464671 I thought I'd put
together a quick script to <del>prove that PHP programmers are
stupid</del> see which set of programmers are the most likely to
make spelling mistakes.

At the time of writing:

#  Language    Illiteracy Level
1  C           54231.4
2  PHP         27022.9
3  Java        22017.1
4  Python      8137.8
5  Perl        4956.0
6  JavaScript  4252.0
7  Ruby        1642.7
8  Shell       597.5

I'm as atonished as you are. C programmers come out worst.. proving to be almost
twice as lexically challenged as the PHP community.

But don't take my word for it, run it yourself! Just don't take it too
seriously :D

A note on the results:

In the process of doing this I've discovered a bug in GitHub's search
highlighter. When searching for a word for a particular language, there's a chance
the language name ("<?php", "C" for copyright in headers) will be highlighted if
it appears before the term. Clearly they're doing a conjunctive "<lang> AND
<term>" search and not telling the highlighter to ignore the first term. I've
reported this so that they can make GitHub even more awesome :D
