Jon Davey, 2011
===============

I've created this module to store sample code for some ideas that I've been experimenting with.

Overview
========

membarrier     : Unconventional use of memory protection hardware can increase parallelism

To do
=====
mamxss         : "Monads Ate My XSS" (pron: mamocks). An experiment in XSS prevention
emailtemplates : A Python rewrite of an email templating system I wrote a few years ago
distrisort     : How I'd sort more numbers than the memory of my computer can hold with the help of more cores than I can count
