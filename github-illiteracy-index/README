Inspired by http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3464671 I thought I'd put
together a quick script to <del>prove that PHP programmers are
stupid</del> see which set of programmers are the most likely to
make spelling mistakes.

At the time of writing:

#  Language    Illiteracy  
1  C           0.02877583  
2  C++         0.01682951  
3  Perl        0.01635618  
4  Ruby        0.01560477  
5  JavaScript  0.01330989  
6  Shell       0.01235425  
7  Python      0.01046104  
8  Objective-C 0.00941299  
9  PHP         0.00910218  
10 Java        0.00736395  

I'm as atonished as you are. C programmers come out worst.. proving to be more
than twice as lexically challenged as the PHP community!

But don't take my word for it, see for yourself! Just don't take it too
seriously :D

Deps: sudo pip install urllib3

illiteracy-norm.py is the first version I made. It normalizes each language so
they are made comparable, but ignores the fact that some languages use some
words more than others. The new one is based on good vs bad spellings.

~~

A note on the results:

In the process of doing this I've discovered a bug in GitHub's search
highlighter. When searching for a word for a particular language, there's a chance
the language name ("<?php", "C" for copyright in headers) will be highlighted if
it appears before the term. Clearly they're doing a conjunctive "<lang> AND
<term>" search and not telling the highlighter to ignore the first term. I'm
reporting this so that they can make GitHub even more awesome :D
